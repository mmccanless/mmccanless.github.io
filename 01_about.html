          <p>My name is <b>Michael MCCanless</b> and I am an <b>urban, economic, and digital</b> geographer. Since 2021, I've been pursuing a PhD in Geography at the <a target="blank" href="https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/mjmc273">University of Kentucky</a>.</br>
            <br>My research examines how digital technologies shape the places where we live. I've previously researched the use of AI/ML in credit scoring, the geography of tech startups, and blockchain applications in real estate. My dissertation explores the <b>design, use, and impact of real estate tax software</b> in residential rental portfolios.</p>
          <p>I'm originally from Calhoun in Northwest GA. I'm fond of both Georgias, though only one is home. I have a dog named Miles who likes to eat <em>almost</em> as much as I do.
